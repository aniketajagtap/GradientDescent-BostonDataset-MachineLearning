# GradientDescent-BostonDataset-MachineLearning
This project is an implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm for predictive modeling with N features. In this project, we will explore the impact of different learning rates, the number of iterations, and the use of feature scaling on the algorithm's performance.
Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.

We are given a Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data. The task is to come up with Gradient Descent algorithm and thus predictions for the test dataset given.

The task is to:
1. Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions.
2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.
3. Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps you in getting better results.
